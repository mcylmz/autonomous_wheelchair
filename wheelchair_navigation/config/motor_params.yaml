# Motor Configuration Parameters
# These parameters control the velocity mapping from cmd_vel to motor commands

# Physical wheelchair parameters
wheel_diameter: 0.380          # meters
gear_ratio: 32                 # gearbox reduction ratio
wheel_base: 0.59              # distance between wheels (meters)

# Motor controller limits
max_rpm: 1500                  # maximum motor RPM
max_command: 1000              # maximum command value (driver input range)

# Dead-zone handling
# Commands below min_effective_command are treated as zero
# Commands between min_effective_command and max are linearly scaled
# to output between min_motor_output and max_command
min_effective_command: 15      # minimum meaningful command value (below this = stop)
min_motor_output: 100          # minimum output sent to motors (prevents stall)

# Velocity ramping (acceleration limits)
enable_ramping: true           # enable velocity ramping
max_acceleration: 500          # max change in command value per second (cmd/s)
ramp_rate: 50                  # rate at which to check ramping (Hz)

# Encoder corrections (calibration factors)
encoder_correction_left: 0.980
encoder_correction_right: 0.991

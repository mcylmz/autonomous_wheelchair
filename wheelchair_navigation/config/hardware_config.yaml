# Hardware Configuration
# Physical specifications and device connections for the wheelchair

wheelchair_hardware:
  # Motor controller connection
  device_path: "/dev/ttyACM0"         # Serial port for Roboteq controller
  baud_rate: 115200                    # Serial communication baud rate

  # Physical dimensions
  wheel_diameter: 0.390                # Wheel diameter in meters (measured)
  wheel_base: 0.59                     # Distance between wheels in meters
  wheel_track: 0.59                    # Same as wheel_base for differential drive

  # Drive system
  gear_ratio: 32                       # Gearbox reduction ratio
  encoder_ticks_per_revolution: 1024   # Encoder resolution

  # Encoder calibration (correction factors)
  encoder_correction_left: 0.980       # Multiply left encoder by this
  encoder_correction_right: 0.991      # Multiply right encoder by this

  # Motor specifications
  motor_max_rpm: 1500                  # Maximum motor RPM
  motor_rated_current: 20.0            # Rated continuous current (Amps)
  motor_peak_current: 40.0             # Peak current for short duration (Amps)

  # Controller limits
  max_command_value: 1000              # Maximum command value for controller

  # Battery specifications
  battery_nominal_voltage: 24.0        # Nominal battery voltage (V)
  battery_cells: 6                     # Number of cells (for SLA: 12V x 2)
  battery_capacity_ah: 55.0            # Battery capacity in Amp-hours

# Notes:
# - Measure wheel_diameter and wheel_base accurately for odometry
# - encoder_correction factors compensate for wear and manufacturing variance
# - Adjust device_path if controller is on different port
# - Battery specs help estimate runtime and set voltage thresholds

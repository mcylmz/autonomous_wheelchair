# Wheelchair Diagnostics Configuration
# Thresholds for system health monitoring

diagnostics:
  # Battery voltage thresholds (Volts)
  battery_voltage_warn: 22.0     # Warn when battery drops below this
  battery_voltage_error: 20.0    # Error when battery drops below this (critical)

  # Motor temperature thresholds (Celsius)
  motor_temp_warn: 60.0          # Warn when motor temp exceeds this
  motor_temp_error: 75.0         # Error when motor temp exceeds this (critical)

  # Motor current thresholds (Amps)
  motor_current_warn: 25.0       # Warn when current exceeds this
  motor_current_error: 30.0      # Error when current exceeds this (overload)

  # Communication timeout (seconds)
  data_timeout: 0.5              # Report error if data older than this

  # Diagnostic update rate (Hz)
  update_rate: 1.0               # How often to publish diagnostics

# Notes:
# - WARN level: System can continue operating but should be monitored
# - ERROR level: System should stop or enter safe mode
# - Adjust thresholds based on your wheelchair's specifications
# - Battery thresholds depend on battery chemistry (24V nominal assumed)
# - Motor thresholds depend on motor specifications
